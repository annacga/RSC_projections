## üß™ Advanced Analyses

### Detailed methodology is described in the publication‚Äôs Methods section.
### All advanced analysis methods are organized within the analysis/ folder:

### üî¨ Cell Classification
- **Location:** `analysis/cellClassification/`  
- Based on **generalized linear models (GLMs)** adapted from Hardcastle et al., 2017.  
- Axons are classified by comparing model performance against a fixed mean firing rate baseline using cross-validation and statistical testing.  
- Axons not outperforming the baseline are considered **not tuned**; others are classified according to which variables they encode (position, speed, acceleration, or licking).  
- Multiple tuning is assigned if no single model significantly outperforms others.  
- Classification significance and chance levels are estimated through permutation testing.  
- Detailed explanation available in the publication‚Äôs Methods section.

### üß† Bayesian Decoding
- **Location:** `analysis/decoding/`  
- Predicts the animal's position on the wheel using Bayesian inference based on axonal activity.  
- Assumes statistical independence of axonal signals and models firing rates with a Poisson distribution.  
- Employs cross-validation and optimized hyperparameters to minimize decoding error.  
- Decoding error quantified as mean distance between predicted and actual positions.  
- Chance decoding error estimated through random shuffling of position labels.  


### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Skaggs Information Score
- **Location:** `analysis/skaggs/`  
- Calculates the Skaggs spatial information score to quantify spatial coding based on calcium activity maps, adapted for ŒîF/F signals using a scaling factor.  
- See the Spatial Binning and Information Score section for details on calculation and normalization.
